# Reddit-Spoiler-Hightlight

Hi, this is a short script to help you hightlight the spoiler marked title with a much UGLY color so you will never miss it.

This might be a wonderful script for those who always mistake spoiler blur for NSFW <del>(which is my routine)</del>.

You can change the color as you wish. Please check the codes and find my comments. 

Send messages to [me](https://www.reddit.com/user/Elypha) if there's any problem. Have fun with Reddit!
